# CO₂ Emissions Analysis Project

## Project Overview
This project analyzes global CO₂ emissions data to understand trends and patterns over time. It includes data cleaning, exploratory analysis, and visualizations.

---

## Dataset
The project uses the dataset `co2_data.csv` located in the `data/` folder.  
It contains information such as:
- Country-wise CO₂ emissions
- Yearly emission data
- Energy consumption and related indicators

---

## Project Structure
The repository is organized to separate data, analysis, and scripts for clarity:  
- `data/` – Contains the CO₂ emissions dataset used for analysis.  
- `notebooks/` – Jupyter notebooks that show step-by-step data exploration, cleaning, and visualizations.  
- `src/` – Python scripts with functions for data processing and generating plots.  
- `README.md` – This file, providing an overview of the project and instructions.

---

## How to Use
- Open notebooks in `notebooks/` to explore analysis and visualizations.  
- Run scripts in `src/` to process data or generate plots programmatically.

---

## Key Insights
- Global CO₂ emissions have increased over the past decades.  
- Developed countries show a slower growth due to renewable energy adoption.  
- Emerging economies contribute significantly to the rising trend.
